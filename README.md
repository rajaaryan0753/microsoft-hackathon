<h3># Microsoft-hackathon <br>
# idea for codefundo</h3>

<h2>What are we planning to build ?</h2>
<p>
As part of our participation in Microsoft codefundo++ 2019, we are planning to build a mobile application that will facilitate Indian voters to vote online during national and state level elections. While the app will include several features, the following have been tentatively thought of:
  
  <ul>
    <li> Users can log into their accounts using their unique e-voter IDs.
    <li> A registration plaform will be provided for new eligible users who are not in governemnt list.
    <li> Users can "open" the ballot box in real time, and observe the number of votes each candidate has secured.
    <li> Users can observe and modify their votes at any time before the election ends, and hence, be able to know for sure that the vote they cast reaches the candidate it was meant for. This will afford the election process a transparency and flexibility hitherto impossible with conventional, physical voting schemes. 
    <li> A platform will be made available for people to voice their opinions anonymously which will also help the candidate to know his consitutency in a better way. Leveraging the power of machine translation, these opinions will then be made available in local languages for the benefit of people less well-versed with English and/or Hindi.
    <li> As soon as the election ends, the app will compute and display the results. This will be a huge improvement over the current waiting time between the end of an election and the time when the results are declared.
      
  </ul>
  
</p>


<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
Voters will cast their vote through the mobile application and then comes the role of  Blockchain application where a  Blockcahin network will be created among Election Commission of India(ECI), Governament officials and  National Media  computer systems and from the property of Blockchain which will ensure the following things listed below:
</p>
  <ol>
  <li> 
    <p>
      Every system will act as Nodes and in Blockchain every Nodes on the network participate to ensure that all copies of the data distributed across the network are the same. This will ensure that each vote is counted and not changed and as the data is digital the counting process will be quick enough to provide the result in few minutes. 
    </p>
  </li>
   <li><p> In the registration part for new user a new chain will be generated to store the data and provide safely to ECI without altering any data and verification can verification of these eligible voter will be done by Aadhar card data similar like face identification or finger print(As we are talking in Indian context).</p>  
    
  </ol>



<h2>How users can get started with the project?</h2>
<p>
  Basically there will be a mobile based login application which will allow the voters to vote(for testing  purpose we will using mailchimp to send respective credentials to voters when they register.Later in future considering the Indian election scenario for making the process of voting more secure <strong>Aadhar card</strong> can be come into play which will check or validate through finger print or retina based verification.These extra feature will work on the same basis depending upon thumb lock and face lock used in the mobile.)

<h2>What dataset(s) are we using?</h2>
<p> Below are the following government dataset available on  <a href="https://data.gov.in/">Open Government Data Platform India </a>which we are planning to use.

</p>


<h2>What technology are we using?</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Microsoft Azure Blockchain</strong></li> 
     <li> Github</li> 
    <li> Mailchimp <en>(for testing purpose of client side application) </en></li> 
     
  </ul>
