<h3># Microsoft-hackathon <br>
# idea for codefundo</h3>

<h2>What are we planning to build ?</h2>
<p>
As part of our participation in Microsoft codefundo++ 2019, we are planning to build a mobile application that will facilitate Indian voters to vote online during national and state level elections. While the app will include several features, the following have been tentatively thought of:
  
  <ul>
    <li> Users can log into their accounts using their unique e-voter IDs.
    <li> A registration plaform will be provided for new eligible users who are not in governemnt list.
    <li> Users can "open" the ballot box in real time, and observe the number of votes each candidate has secured.
    <li> Users can observe and modify their votes at any time before the election ends, and hence, be able to know for sure that the vote they cast reaches the candidate it was meant for. This will afford the election process a transparency and flexibility hitherto impossible with conventional, physical voting schemes. 
    <li> A platform will be made available for people to voice their opinions anonymously which will also help the candidate to know his consitutency in a better way. Leveraging the power of machine translation, these opinions will then be made available in local languages for the benefit of people less well-versed with English and/or Hindi.
    <li> As soon as the election ends, the app will compute and display the results. This will be a huge improvement over the current waiting time between the end of an election and the time when the results are declared.
      
  </ul>
  
</p>


<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
Voters will cast their vote through the mobile application, which will have the Blockchain ledger running in the background. This ledger will be created among Election Commission of India(ECI), Governament officials and  National Media  computer systems:
</p>
  <ol>
  <li> 
    <p>
      Every system will act as a Node. The Nodes, acting together to validate any new information added to the Blockchain, will ensure that any new vote once recorded, cannot be tempered with by a malicious entity. 
    </p>
  </li>
   <li><p>While registering a new user, a new chain will be generated to store the data and provide it safely to ECI without altering any of the same; and authentication of the voter will be done provisionally via <strong>Aadhar card</strong> details (fingerprint or iris authentication).</p>  
    
  </ol>



<h2>How users can get started with the project?</h2>
<p>
  At the completion of our project, a mobile-based application will be deployed, which will allow voters to login and vote in favour of their favorite candidate(s) (for testing purposes, we will be using mailchimp to send respective credentials to voters when they register. In the future, however, towards the end-goal of securing the process of voting during Indian election, <strong>Aadhar card</strong> can be considered as a potential candidate for user validation via fingerprint or iris authentication. The problem of securing the unique ID of a user - something that will be assigned and maintained off the Blockchain, will have to be dealt with separately once the rest or the application has been developed.)
</p>
<p>
  Users will have access to a wall on which they can post their problems & queries. In the interest of maintaining a healthy and spam-free enviromnent, the number of posts allowed per user per day will be restricted on the basis of some suitable heuristic. 
 </p>
 
  
<h2>What technology are we using?</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Microsoft Azure Blockchain</strong> as Cloud Computing Platform</li> 
    <li><strong>Github</strong> for version control</li> 
    <li><strong>Mailchimp</strong> for the purpose of testing the client side application</li>
    <li><strong>Android Studio</strong> for development of the Android App, and</li>
    <li>other technologies as and when the need for the same arises.
     
  </ul>
